Professor Uhe

IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class：

First of all, my biggest achievement is undoubtedly learning pandas. I have a certain programming foundation before, but I have not studied data. Through this course, I had a good opportunity to learn and practice some Python packages related to data processing, such as pandas. This will be of great help to my future study career and work career. Through constant contact in class, I think I can already use python very well for data analysis. Secondly, understand and learn about data visualization. Among them, I think bqplot and seaborn are the most useful. These two visualization packages allow me to complete my visualization content in more ways. Regardless of the type of visualization method, the accuracy or aesthetics of the visualization, bqplot and seaborn are both better than the original visualization. By choosing a visualization method that better meets our needs, we will use a large amount of text to reflect the value and meaning of the data. More accurate visualizations help us not worry about visualizations giving users the wrong perspective. Finally, I think the most important thing that cannot be ignored in visualization is the aesthetics of the visualization. Visualization is data content that starts with vision. If it is not beautiful enough, users will subconsciously give up reading and thinking about its meaning. Through studying this class, I became very aware of these three important points for visualization. By trying various visualization methods, I think my ability to create visual content has been significantly improved.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher：

While I think the professor has done a great job, I still think you could show us more visualizations in class. Especially the code content of bqplot and seaborn. Although I think completing visualization through self-study is a very effective process, its initial efficiency cost is a bit too high. This resulted in me not being able to keep up with the learning pace of the class. I think it would be a better teaching method if we can lead students to complete some visual code examples in class.
